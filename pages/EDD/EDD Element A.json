      "label": "Problem Background and Statistics",
      "content": "The team’s market research synthesizes findings from three currently marketed products and three relevant patents to characterize the market space for girls’ STEM toys. The reviewed products target learners roughly ages 3-12 and carried by mainstream retailers as well as educational suppliers, indicating ready discoverability and present market demand. Patent activity within the same space, explicitly including a patent targeted towards encouraging girls’ interest in STEM, corroborates that industry actors already recognize both the need and commercial potential of solutions focused on girls’ engagement. Together, these sources establish an actual baseline for the problem.<br>Quantitatively, the team’s research covered many price bands, with list prices ranging from $23 to $150 with sale prices listed near ~$13 for budget sets and ~$120 for premium kits. Such dispersion matters for equity of access and for parental value judgements at the time of purchase, particularly when ongoing consumables or unclear instructions dilute learning value over time. Qualitatively, two of the three products researched explicitly marketed themselves as “for girls”, while one positioned itself as “boys & girls”, revealing mixed norms in audience signaling that can shape caregiver reception and children’s expectations before play even begins. Content analyses further indicate uneven depth: while several products provide credible STEM affordances (e.g., microscopy or mechanical construction), others leaned heavily on themed aesthetics or consumable-heavy activities that offer limited pathways for sustainable inquiry without additional purchases. Figures A-B (prices and marketing languages) visualize these patterns and invigorate the team’s emphasis on authentic inquiry, modular challenge progressions, and neutral, mechanics-first branding in the proposed design."

      "label": "Consumer Related Research",
      "content": "The team’s consumer-related research draws on both online product critiques directly by the team. Broader consumer perspectives have not yet been collected and will be incorporated through planned surveys and interviews. For example, the Butterfly EduFields Girls Mini Engineering Kit offered topical variety but was criticized for confusing instructions and stereotyped schematics such as hair dryers or vacuums. The WhalesBot B3 Pro introduced novel screen-free coding with pens and cards, though its premium price raised concerns especially with its perceived inadequacy in teaching core coding skills. One of coding’s biggest strengths is persistence and the ability to build and save immutable logic over time, whereas this product required the child to manually perform one action at a time with the pen and cards for each run, offering no option to store or reuse logic. The Rurvale Magnetic Tiles set, marketed as “Toddler Girl Toys”, was praised for affordability during sales but limited in piece count and depth of STEM content beyond early spatial play. Collectively, these cases illustrate how price, branding, and instructional clarity interact to shape parent and child experiences.<br>Parents remain the primary purchasers and decision-makers, and the team’s consumer pool reflects this, including women in engineering, parents and guardians, and individuals with sisters who provide insight into both buyer behavior and user identity. Planned surveys and interviews will measure purchase frequency, the relative importance of features such as durability and learning outcomes, and reactions to packaging language."

      "label": "Validation of Problem",
      "content": "The validation of the problem rests on three dimensions: educational, technical, and economic. From an educational perspective, peer-reviewed commentary highlights that authentic inquiry requires prediction, data collection, and evidence-based conclusions, all of which are frequently absent from craft-style activities. The proposed kit therefore emphasizes NGSS-aligned practices, note booking, and repeatable experiments to encourage transferable skills. From a technical perspective, documented critiques involve unclear instructions, limited and shallow mechanics without progressive extensions. These issues demonstrate opportunities for clearer affordances, higher quality tolerances, and modular challenge paths that keep leaners engaged over time. Finally, from an economic perspective, the team noted that STEM toys in this category often vary by as much as six to seven times in price and sometimes impose additional consumable costs, producing uneven value propositions for families. A reusable, engaging, and transparently scaffolded kit could address these gaps by offering parents confidence in both learning outcomes and long-term value."

      "content": "Evidence from market scans, patents, and scholarly literature converge on a solvable problem: many offerings labeled for girls underdeliver on authentic STEM engagement and return unequal value. The team’s design response prioritizes NGSS-aligned inquiry, neutral and mechanics-forward packaging, modular challenge progressions, and caregiver co-play scaffolds to incentivize persistence. Expert consultation will bridge research and classroom practice, while parent-focused consumer feedback will align features with purchasing criteria. By addressing teaching methods, usability, and economics together, the proposed construction kit is positioned to close a documented engagement gap and deliver durable learning value."
